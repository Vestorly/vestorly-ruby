        robo-signing scandal. That finally prompted regulators and law enforcement
        to take some sort of meaningful action. Regulators swear up and down that
        this time if the banks break the rules, there will be consequences. We''ll
        see about that, but at least it''s movement in the right direction.</p><p

        on what you think \"recovering\" means. A number of analysts think house prices
        will bottom this year. But it will likely take until 2014 or so before the
        number of homes facing foreclosure descends to something like normal levels.</p></blockquote><p

        mind: Of the mortgages that big banks service, they only actually hold roughly
        10% on their balance sheets. And they''ve been doing modifications that reduce
        the borrower''s principal for years on those loans. Last quarter, about 25%
        of the mods the banks did on their own loans involved principal reduction.

        negotiations over the fiscal cliff continue to move like molasses, creating

        Democrats duke it out in Washington, how will you prepare? For a low-risk
        approach, consider financial advisor Richard Band&rsquo;s advice:</p>\r\n\r\n<p
        style=\"margin-left:.5in;\">1.  <strong>Increase holdings in bonds and cash</strong>:
        Reliable investments in bond funds with long maturities will offset higher
        interest rates in the future, and are easy to replace. Consider putting more
        cash in money markets as well. </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:.5in;\">2.  <strong>Decrease
        holdings in stocks or funds with troubling forecasts</strong>: Get rid of
        stocks with lower projected earnings in 2013. If a mutual fund has lagged
        its peer group for the past three years, can it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:.5in;\">3.  <strong>Buy
        discounted stocks of businesses providing essential goods and services</strong>:
        Well-run utility companies and household names like Coca-Cola (KO), IBM (IBM)
        and McDonald&rsquo;s (MCD) have all stood up to years of economic adversity
        with innovative product development and marketing. They&rsquo;ll still be
        around and fighting next year. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Fiscal cliff update</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early
        indications of Republican concessions point to House Speaker John Boehner
        proposing tax increases for those with incomes of $1 million or more. This
        is still short of what the Democrats and President Obama want, which are tax
        increases on wealthy Americans earning upwards of $250,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Affluent
        Americans with the most to lose are &ldquo;taking preemptive action to get
        out of harm&rsquo;s way&hellip;moving to sell investment homes, off-load stocks,
        expand charitable donations and establish tax-sheltering gifts before the
        end of the year,&rdquo; according to the <em>Washington Post</em>. Others
        are simply moving around assets they believe will be most impacted should
        higher taxes be implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ordinary Americans, whose primary
        source of income is derived from wages, will be able to do little with mandatory
        higher payroll taxes and fewer deductions and credits. Investment income on
        tax-deferred vehicles such as 401(k)s make any tax changes on investments
        highly immaterial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Companies are also taking precautions, but
        with details of budget negotiations largely unsettled, it&rsquo;s hard to
        know against what. Some are freezing hiring and holding investments. GE announced

        of 111 and an estimated $30 to $50 billion in damages. Almost 30,000 New Yorkers
        remain displaced after their homes were destroyed. Aggravating an already
        tense situation, a powerful Nor&rsquo;easter storm is set to hit mid-week,
        bringing brutal cold, wind and rain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Yorkers have proved
        their resilience by resuming to normalcy as fast as possible, with Mayor Michael
        Bloomberg leading the charge by opening the stock exchange Wednesday. Markets
        saw a resilient upswing for the first half of the day however ended flat at
        13.089, or down 10 points (.08%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The overall impact of Sandy
        should however, be bullish. Many argue that the time and money spent on reconstruction
        stole time and attention away from &ldquo;other&rdquo; wealth creation engines
        and the nation must now work its way back to the status quo. But consider
        these statements by Martin Lowry, author of <em>Debt Spiral.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p
        style=\"margin-left:.5in;\">1. The buildings and infrastructure destroyed
        by Sandy were weak anyway. Government spending to rebuild, while in the long-term
        may not be great for the deficit in the short to medium term will be a great
        job stimulus. </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:.5in;\">2. The person hours
        required for repairs and reconstruction will result in a short-term benefit
        lasting one year or longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:.5in;\">3. Some
        damage was insured and insurance companies will take relatively inactive money
        built up over a long period of time and turn it into high-powered money that
        creates GDP and jobs without subtracting from either in the short term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An

        Auld Lang Syne this evening:</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Global
        Economy Gasping for Air</strong><br />\r\nAccording to the International Monetary
        Fund, the global economy grew just 3.3 percent, down from 3.8 percent in 2011.
        The U.S., the world&rsquo;s largest economy, grew only 2 percent five years
        post-recession. China&rsquo;s economy grew at a 7.4 percent annual rate but
        this was a 3.5-year low for the developing country. And Europe, still in recession,
        barely survived financial crisis only in part to the European Central Bank&rsquo;s
        plan to buy government bonds to help countries with their debts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>
        </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Fiscal Cliff</strong><br />\r\nThe now-infamous
        &ldquo;Fiscal Cliff&rdquo; is the ultimate procastinator&rsquo;s dream-turned-nightmare.
        It&rsquo;s been there, cooking on the back burner and only now are legislators
        attempting to put out the fire of the almost $600 billion in tax cuts and
        spending increases set to take place January 1. Let&rsquo;s wish them all
        a non-partisan &ldquo;Godspeed, and good luck,&rdquo; in reaching an amicable
        decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. U.S. Presidential Election</strong><br
        />\r\nUnemployment topped 8 percent for 43 straight months under President
        Obama, however his familiarity, this year&rsquo;s job growth numbers and a
        proposal to stabilize the economy and avert the fiscal cliff landed him re-election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>
        </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Facebook IPO</strong><br />\r\nExcitement ensued
        when Facebook announced its IPO&mdash;what many regarded as the hottest tech
        offering since Google&rsquo;s in 2004. Facebook&rsquo;s market value was $104
        billion, but not for long. Nasdaq trading glitches and allegations of improperly
        disclosed revenue gaps and an overpriced IPO led to traders losing confidence.
        The stock lost half its IPO value within three months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5.
        Housing Recovery</strong><br />\r\nA sure sign of economic recovery, housing
        is back. Record-low mortgage rates energized home demand and sales. Builders
        are re-building and home prices are rising. It&rsquo;s been a rough six years
        resulting in 4 million foreclosed homes but for the first time since 2005
        housing has boosted U.S. economic growth.</p>\r\n","client_only":false,"down_votes":0,"draft_post_id":null,"external_url":null,"external_url_source":null,"for_approval":false,"from_newscred":false,"has_sent":false,"image_big_url":null,"image_small_url":null,"img":"","impressions_count":null,"is_added_to_newsletter":false,"is_clone":false,"is_curate":false,"is_draft":false,"is_pre_approved":true,"link":null,"logo_url":null,"message_clicks":0,"message_sign_ups":0,"messages":0,"needs_sanitize":true,"newsletter_sent_at":null,"number_of_views":0,"parent_post_id":null,"post_date":"2013-01-22T05:00:00+00:00","prospect_only":false,"publish_to_social":null,"published_at":null,"published_post_cacheid":null,"random":0.6993154643418972,"s3_folder":null,"send_on_publish":false,"slug":"top-5-business-stories-of-2012-2013","slug_history":[],"title":"Top

        is the Federal Reserve preventing another credit crisis? Let us count the
        ways. The Fed is hard at work on preventing repeats of &ldquo;too-big-to-fail&rdquo;
        banks from possibly weakening the U.S. financial system on a grand scale,
        much as they did in 2008&rsquo;s credit crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dodd-Frank
        financial reform bill has enacted measures such as banks adhering to increased
        capital requirements. Global Basel III regulations follow suit and mirror
        these stipulations. All this simply means is that banks will now be required
        to hold onto more cash and greater liquid reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In speeches
        before the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Fed governor Daniel
        Tarullo announced proposals that would force the nation&rsquo;s smallest and
        largest banks to stockpile funds in case of a shock to the financial system.
        The theory is that if credit was again squeezed and banks could no longer
        borrow or refinance debt to sustain daily operations, they could turn to their
        own capital reserves to stave off insolvency. Sounds simple and logical, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The
        proposals also call for premiums on banks with assets more than $50 billion
        (think the biggest names here: Citigroup, JP Morgan, HSBC, etc.) to hold around
        2.5 percent of more &quot;high-quality&quot; capital. Banks that securitize
        products (packaging debt for resale and collecting interest from the debt)
        would also be required to retain a portion of the securities they&rsquo;ve
        sponsored. This is significant because banks would be prevented from issuing
        securities in bets they know they will lose and then selling these securities
        to unfortunate souls, much as Goldman Sachs did when issuing credit-default
        swaps against subprime mortgages sold to AIG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Requiring banks
        to hold more long-term debt is also on the horizon. Banks currently hold mostly
        short-term Treasury bonds with two to three year maturity dates. Banks would
        now be encouraged to align interests with the economy as a whole and longer-term
        basis, however many are concerned that if interest rates rise long-term money
        purchased at lower interest rates will decrease the value of these holdings.
        Whether banks can even get to higher capitalization or hold long-term debt
        remains to be seen, among other impacts of regulation on foreign banks in
        the U.S.</p>\r\n","client_only":false,"down_votes":0,"draft_post_id":"512bc758ada26b000200082e","external_url":null,"external_url_source":null,"for_approval":false,"from_newscred":false,"has_sent":false,"image_big_url":null,"image_small_url":null,"img":"","impressions_count":0,"is_added_to_newsletter":false,"is_clone":false,"is_curate":false,"is_draft":false,"is_pre_approved":true,"link":null,"logo_url":null,"message_clicks":0,"message_sign_ups":0,"messages":0,"needs_sanitize":true,"newsletter_sent_at":null,"number_of_views":0,"parent_post_id":null,"post_date":"2013-02-25T05:00:00+00:00","prospect_only":false,"publish_to_social":null,"published_at":null,"published_post_cacheid":null,"random":0.09114648071950793,"s3_folder":null,"send_on_publish":false,"slug":"the-fed-wants-to-prevent-another-credit-crisis-2","slug_history":[],"title":"The

        would expand 0.1 percent in 2013, but tight lending conditions and record
        unemployment&mdash;which is expected to peak at 12.2 percent&mdash;have dashed
        any hopes of a recovery this year. With inflation at 1.8 percent, pressure

        their prospects, according to a business climate index compiled by think tank
        <em>lfo</em>. 7,000 businesses were surveyed resulting in the biggest monthly
        rise to 107.4 in February, from 104.3 in January. The increase was the highest
        since July 2010 and the fourth in a row; it also matches improving PMI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>

        The aeronautics company wants the FAA to allow its Dreamliners jets to resume
        passenger flights hopefully by next month. CEO Jim McNerney told the <em>Wall

        the new console will be Sony&rsquo;s savior remains to be seen as it has tough

        of 2012, the gap reached $4.7 trillion, the highest since records began in
        1976. While the trend suggests the U.S. is an attractive place to store money,

        Rodrigo Campos</p>\r\n              <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - The stock market''s
        robust rally was slowing even before Friday''s jobs report, but the red flag
        sent up by the weak payrolls data makes the path to more gains less secure.</p>\r\n              <p>It
        means the bulls will have to look to earnings for a way to keep the rally
        going. The S&amp;P 500 hit an all-time closing high on Tuesday, but lately
        defensive stocks have been leading the charge, and notable growth indexes
        are slipping.</p>\r\n              <p>This rotation has many thinking the
        long-awaited market correction is nigh. A 3 percent decline in the Russell
        2000 index &lt;.RUT&gt; this week seemed to be a confirmation of the trend.</p>\r\n              <p>\"Momentum
        I think has been slowing a bit, and it would be interesting to see if this
        is just a one-session sell-off,\" said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist
        at Delta Global Asset Management in Boston, about Friday''s decline.</p>\r\n              <p>In
        the first quarter, the benchmark''s healthcare index &lt;.SPXHC&gt; added
        15.2 percent and utilities &lt;.SPLRCU&gt; gained 11.8 percent, besting the
        broad S&amp;P 500''s 10 percent gain.</p>\r\n              <p>The transition
        into defensive stocks may respond to investors'' taking into account the effect
        of higher payroll taxes this year and the $85 billion in government spending
        cuts that started to trickle at the beginning of the year.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        shift is \"a rotation into sectors less affected by a short-term slowdown
        in the consumer,\" said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star
        Investment Management Corp in Chicago.</p>\r\n              <p>EARNINGS HOLD
        THE KEY</p>\r\n              <p>Earnings season starts in earnest next week,
        with the highlight coming from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co &lt;JPM.N&gt; and Wells
        Fargo &amp; Co &lt;WFC.N&gt; on Friday. Details on Wells Fargo''s earnings
        will be dissected for clues on the health of the housing market.</p>\r\n              <p>Overall,
        S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to have risen 1.5 percent last quarter,
        down from a 4.3 percent gain expected at the start of the year, according
        to Thomson Reuters data.</p>\r\n              <p>Investors \"are really waiting
        for the earnings season on balance to disappoint,\" said Zaro.</p>\r\n              <p>Companies
        have caught up on the lowered expectations, and negative outlooks have been
        predominant ahead of earnings season. In fact, the negative-to-positive guidance
        ratio from S&amp;P 500 companies is at its highest since the third quarter
        of 2001, according to Thomson Reuters data.</p>\r\n              <p>At 4.7,
        the ratio is the sixth-highest among 69 readings dating to 1996.</p>\r\n              <p>\"Companies
        understand that since the economy is weak there''s no reason to be a hero
        and give guidance you can''t beat,\" said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist
        at the ConvergEx Group in New York.</p>\r\n              <p>F5 Networks &lt;FFIV.O&gt;
        was the latest and one of the most dramatic examples of lowered earnings expectations.
        The network equipment maker partly blamed lower government sales for its profit
        warning late on Thursday, which erased almost a fifth of its market value
        on Friday.</p>\r\n              <p>In past quarters, revenue beats have taken
        the focus off the bottom line as investors were expecting the stronger economy
        to translate into more sales, but that may not be the case this time around.</p>\r\n              <p>\"At
        this point earnings are going to be perhaps more important than revenues only
        because we know Q1 was only a so-so quarter for the economy,\" said Colas.</p>\r\n              <p>\"It''s
        not going to be a surprise if revenues are a little bit light. Where we really
        have to make sure the numbers work is at the earnings level.\"</p>\r\n              <p>BUSY
        WEEK FOR THE FED</p>\r\n              <p>The Federal Reserve could be next
        week''s wild card. Indications of renewed support for loose monetary policy
        - or the slightest hint in the direction of tightening - have triggered wild
        moves in the market.</p>\r\n              <p>The minutes of the March FOMC
        meeting are due on Wednesday and market participants will look for insight
        into the debate regarding the amount and duration of bond purchases the U.S.
        central bank is executing monthly.</p>\r\n              <p>The hawkish argument
        - a reduction of stimulus - was dented by Friday''s job report, so any mention
        of it in the minutes may not trigger panic. But more than a dozen speeches
        by various Fed officers next week could stir things up.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        economic reports calendar is light except for consumer data. Retailers are
        expected to post a 1.9 percent rise in sales for last month, compared with
        a gain of 2.9 percent in March last year when same-store sales figures are
        published Thursday.</p>\r\n              <p>The Commerce Department posts
        its own retail sales figures on Friday, followed by the Thomson Reuters/University
        of Michigan survey of consumers.</p>\r\n              <p>(Reporting by Rodrigo

        - Hedge fund manager William Ackman said that Ron Johnson, the chief executive
        he handpicked to turn around JC Penney, has made \"big mistakes\" and the
        impact on the struggling retailer has been \"very close to a disaster.\"</p>\r\n              <p>The
        \"criticism is deserved,\" Ackman said on Friday of Johnson, a former Apple
        executive who has come under fire for his dramatic plans to overhaul the staid
        retailer with cost cuts, more fashionable merchandise and a new pricing strategy.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        stock price has plummeted 27.6 percent in the first quarter as Johnson''s
        plans alienated JC Penney''s core clientele and has not resonated with new
        shoppers.</p>\r\n              <p>\"One of the big mistakes was perhaps too
        much change too quickly without adequate testing on what the impact would
        be,\" Ackman said on Friday at an investment conference sponsored by Thomson
        Reuters.</p>\r\n              <p>After months of being a public cheerleader
        for Johnson, often saying that he was a doing a great job, the fund manager
        tempered his normally upbeat comments on Friday.</p>\r\n              <p>Speaking
        bluntly, Ackman, who sits on the JC Penney board and whose $12 billion Pershing
        Square Capital Management is the company''s largest shareholder, said big
        mistakes have been made remaking the 110 year-old retail brand.</p>\r\n              <p>JC
        Penney traditionally drew in customers with big sales and coupons but Johnson
        has been criticized for eliminating those in favor of every day low prices.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        company has now brought back their old pricing strategy to try to bring shoppers
        back.</p>\r\n              <p>Ackman said that Johnson faces one of the toughest
        challenges in corporate America in cutting costs and changing the merchandise
        and that \"the impact has been, on a consolidated basis, very close to a disaster.\"</p>\r\n              <p>Right
        now Johnson is \"working very aggressively with his team to fix the mistakes
        that have been made, and there have been some big mistakes,\" Ackman said.</p>\r\n              <p>JC
        Penney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\r\n              <p>JC
        Penney''s stock price climbed 3.3 percent on Friday to $15.57 in late afternoon
        trading.</p>\r\n              <p>Ackman, a favorite with pension funds and
        wealthy investors, has come under criticism for bets on retailers in the past,
        including bets on Target and bookseller Borders a few years ago. Currently
        Pershing Square is sitting on roughly $500 million in paper losses in JC Penney.</p>\r\n              <p>\"If
        you get a retailer fixed and you can replicate it, it''s about the best way
        to make money,\" he said.</p>\r\n              <p>While JC Penney''s losses
        are making headlines, Ackman''s portfolio gained 6.1 percent during the first
        quarter thanks to bets on Canadian Pacific Railway and Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>\r\n              <p>In
        a nod to his ongoing commitment to JC Penney''s fortunes, the billionaire
        investment manager wore socks purchased at JC Penney.</p>\r\n              <p>HERBALIFE
        BATTLE</p>\r\n              <p>At the conference Ackman was also asked about
        his other high profile investments, including nutritional supplements company
        Herbalife on which Pershing Square has a $1 billion short bet, expecting the
        multi-level marketing company''s share price will move to zero.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        investment has been the talk of Wall Street in recent months as other well-known
        hedge fund managers, including Carl Icahn and Daniel Loeb, moved to the other
        side of the bet with long positions in Herbalife.</p>\r\n              <p>\"Taking
        a short position and going public with it is a pretty serious business,\"
        Ackman said. \"Did I think a group of hedge fund managers would take the other
        side of the trade and try to orchestrate a short squeeze? No, I didn''t think
        that,\" Ackman said.</p>\r\n              <p>Short-sellers borrow shares and
        sell them, seeking to profit by returning them after buying them back at a
        lower price. A short squeeze occurs when the share price rises instead, forcing
        the borrowers to try to buy them back at a higher price, thus pushing the
        share price even higher.</p>\r\n              <p>Talking about the public
        feud over Herbalife, Ackman said that the $2.25 trillion hedge fund industry,
        once close-knit where managers often worked collaboratively, now seems much
        more competitive.</p>\r\n              <p>\"This was the first case where
        there was a lot of sniping going on between managers,\" he said, referring
        to the recent backbiting over the Herbalife trade.</p>\r\n              <p>But
        he acknowledged that hedge fund managers can''t be overly sensitive. \"You
        have to have thick skin to be in this business.\"</p>\r\n              <p>(Reporting

        88,000 last month outside the farming sector, the Labor Department said on
        Friday.</p>\r\n              <p>That was well below market expectations for
        a 200,000 increase and fell short of even the most pessimistic forecast in
        a Reuters poll. The jobless rate ticked a tenth of a point lower to 7.6 percent
        largely due to people dropping out of the work force.</p>\r\n              <p>\"The
        U.S. economy just hit a major speed bump,\" said Marcus Bullus, trading director
        at MB Capital in London.</p>\r\n              <p>Some of the weakness appeared
        due to higher tax rates that took effect in January. While recent reports
        have pointed to relatively buoyant retail sales in January and February, Friday''s
        data showed retailers actually cut staff in March by 24,100, making it the
        hardest-hit sector last month.</p>\r\n              <p>Moreover, the government
        said hiring in the retail sector was weaker in January and February than initially
        thought.</p>\r\n              <p>The report rattled investors and sent U.S.
        stocks lower, contributing to the biggest weekly decline for share prices
        this year. Benchmark Treasury debt yields fell to their lowest this year and
        the dollar declined against a basket of currencies.</p>\r\n              <p>It
        was unclear whether across-the-board federal budget cuts that began in March
        played a role in the weak pace of hiring, although nervousness over the cuts
        might have made businesses shy about taking on more staff.</p>\r\n              <p>Some
        economists cautioned against reading too much into the report, though the
        data nonetheless raised questions over whether the strong hiring seen in the
        winter actually meant the economy had shifted into a higher gear.</p>\r\n              <p>\"We
        don''t think there is enough signal here to conclude the U.S. economy is wobbling.
        Rather, it appears that the underlying trend has not improved as much as the
        January-February data suggested,\" said Julia Coronado, an economist at BNP
        Paribas in New York.</p>\r\n              <p>AMMUNITION FOR THE FED</p>\r\n              <p>March''s
        slowdown in job growth could make policymakers at the Federal Reserve more
        confident about continuing a bond-buying stimulus program. Prior advances
        in the labor market recovery had fueled discussion at the central bank over
        whether to dial back the purchases, perhaps as soon as this summer.</p>\r\n              <p>\"This
        could give them the green light to stay with this policy longer,\" said Brian
        Rehling, chief fixed income strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        employment report did have some positive news for the economy. The Labor Department
        revised readings for January and February to show 61,000 more jobs added than
        previously estimated. The average workweek rose to its highest level in a
        year.</p>\r\n              <p>\"Companies ramped up working hours instead
        of hiring additional people. The fact that labor demand kept rising should
        bode well for future job gains,\" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist
        at UniCredit Research in New York.</p>\r\n              <p>The construction
        sector added 18,000 jobs, reinforcing the view that a recovery in the housing
        sector has become entrenched.</p>\r\n              <p>Separate reports on
        Friday also gave upbeat signals. The U.S. trade gap narrowed in February due
        to rising exports and falling crude oil imports, while U.S. consumer credit
        that month recorded its biggest increase in half a year.</p>\r\n              <p>AUSTERITY''S
        BITE</p>\r\n              <p>But analysts point out that federal spending
        cuts have only just begun and will be a more substantial drag on the economy
        between April and June, when many government workers begin taking days off
        work without pay.</p>\r\n              <p>In March, government payrolls fell
        only 7,000, partly reversing a 14,000-job gain from February.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        Congressional Budget Office has estimated that tighter fiscal policy will
        subtract about 1.5 percentage points from economic growth this year.</p>\r\n              <p>\"The
        trend in payrolls is consistent with our expectation that employment growth
        will slow somewhat in coming months (due to) the large, and increasing, fiscal
        drag,\" said Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays in New York.</p>\r\n              <p>Fed
        Chairman Ben Bernanke, who has said the labor market must show sustained improvement
        before monetary stimulus is eased, has voiced concern about the spending cuts.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        jobless rate fell to its lowest since December 2008, but the report showed
        that much of the drop was due to the labor force shrinking by 496,000 people.</p>\r\n              <p>That
        pushed the labor force participation rate - the percentage of working-age
        Americans either with a job or looking for one - to 63.3 percent, its lowest
        since 1979.</p>\r\n              <p>The unemployment rate is derived from
        a survey of households which is separate from the survey of employer payrolls.
        The household survey actually showed employment fell by 206,000 in March.</p>\r\n              <p>Some
        of the people dropping out of the labor force are retiring or going back to
        school, but others have given up the job hunt out of discouragement.</p>\r\n              <p>(Additional

        ended their worst week this year with losses on Friday after a weaker-than-expected
        jobs report undermined confidence in the economy and first-quarter earnings
        growth.</p>\r\n              <p>The jobs data, which showed employers hired
        at the slowest pace in nine months, was the latest in a series of disappointing
        economic reports.</p>\r\n              <p>Companies begin to report quarterly
        earnings next week, which is likely to be another concern for investors in
        light of recent economic data. Analysts'' estimates for earnings growth in
        the first quarter have fallen since late last year, according to Thomson Reuters
        data.</p>\r\n              <p>\"I think earnings season could be less than
        stellar again. Given market performance to date, we could see some softness
        in the market because we''ve generated some healthy returns already,\" said
        Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment
        Management, which has about $13 billion in assets.</p>\r\n              <p>Stocks
        had been rallying on the Fed''s promise to keep providing stimulus and on
        mostly improving U.S. economic data. The S&amp;P 500 is up 8.9 percent since
        the start of the year.</p>\r\n              <p>The S&amp;P 500 was down 1
        percent for the week. All but three of the S&amp;P 500''s 10 industry sectors
        posted declines.</p>\r\n              <p>The government''s job report showed
        88,000 jobs were added in March, less than half economists'' average forecast
        of 200,000. The unemployment rate dipped to 7.6 percent from 7.7 percent,
        largely due to people dropping out of the work force.</p>\r\n              <p>Among
        recent weak data, a report Monday showed U.S. factory activity grew at the
        slowest rate in three months in March.</p>\r\n              <p>The S&amp;P''s
        biggest percentage decliner was network gear maker F5 Networks Inc &lt;FFIV.O&gt;,
        which dropped 19 percent to $73.21 a day after forecasting quarterly earnings
        and revenue well below Wall Street''s expectations.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        Dow Jones industrial average &lt;.DJI&gt; was down 40.86 points, or 0.28 percent,
        at 14,565.25. The Standard &amp; Poor''s 500 Index &lt;.SPX&gt; was down 6.70
        points, or 0.43 percent, at 1,553.28. The Nasdaq Composite Index &lt;.IXIC&gt;
        was down 21.12 points, or 0.66 percent, at 3,203.86.</p>\r\n              <p>For
        the week, the Dow declined 0.1 percent while the Nasdaq dropped 1.9 percent.
        The Russell 2000 index &lt;.TOY&gt; fell 3 percent for the week, its worst
        weekly decline since June.</p>\r\n              <p>Several of F5''s competitors
        were also sharply lower, with Juniper Networks &lt;JNPR.N&gt; off 3.1 percent
        at $17.55 and Citrix Systems &lt;CTXS.O&gt; down 1.2 percent at $68.90.</p>\r\n              <p>Airline
        stocks were hit after J.P Morgan Securities cut its revenue expectations for
        U.S. airlines by 2 percent to 3 percent for 2013 and 2014 and said it expects
        monthly revenue per available seat mile to turn negative for some airlines,
        partly due to the federal government''s automatic spending cuts.</p>\r\n              <p>Delta
        Airlines Inc &lt;DAL.N&gt; fell 2.4 percent to $14.39 and United Continental

        from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from a 4.3 percent
        forecast in January.</p>\r\n              <p>Earnings grew 6.3 percent in
        the fourth-quarter, which was better than a late projection by analysts.</p>\r\n              <p>Volume

        Amy Feldman</p>\r\n              <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tax day this year
        falls on a Monday, making it all the more enticing for procrastinators to
        attempt to cram in all their accounting on the weekend prior. If this is your
        plan, you have a little bit of an excuse: The tax season started slowly as
        the Internal Revenue Service reworked many forms, as required by the year-end
        tax changes. But that doesn''t make it any less painful now.</p>\r\n              <p>If
        you''re among the procrastinators, here are eight last-minute things to consider:</p>\r\n              <p>1.
        IRA contributions</p>\r\n              <p>If you''ve put off your taxes till
        the last minute, chances are you''ve postponed making contributions to any
        Individual Retirement Accounts, too. That deadline is the same as your tax
        return. The 2012 limits are $5,000 ($6,000 if you''re 50 or older), and can
        go to either a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, or be split between the two. If
        you''re among the minority thinking ahead, the limits go up in 2013 - to $5,500
        for everyone, and $6,500 for those allowed to make \"catch-up\" contributions.</p>\r\n              <p>If
        you''re sitting at your dining room table on April 14 and still haven''t taken
        care of this, you can claim the deduction on your return before you make it,
        as long as you invest the money on April 15 - on your way to the post office.</p>\r\n              <p>2.
        HSA contributions</p>\r\n              <p>If you were covered by a high-deductible
        insurance plan in 2012, as Americans increasingly are, you also have until
        April 15 to make a tax-deductible contribution to a Health Savings Account.
        The maximums are $3,100 for singles and $6,250 for families (with catch-up
        contributions of as much as $2,000 for those over 55). Like an IRA, the money
        in an HSA grows tax-free - and you can withdraw it tax-free, too, as long
        as you use it for uninsured medical expenses.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        tax-time bonus: It''s a potentially large deduction that you can take even
        if you don''t itemize.</p>\r\n              <p>3. Education tax breaks</p>\r\n              <p>If
        you have kids in school, don''t forget to take your tax breaks, even if sorting
        them gets complicated. There are a few different credits and deductions, but
        the best one, if you qualify - undergraduate education only - is the American
        opportunity credit. It''s worth $2,500.</p>\r\n              <p>If you need
        records at the last minute for student loan interest or 529 Plan contributions,
        you should be able to find those through your online accounts. (See http://link.reuters.com/vun27t
        for more detail)</p>\r\n              <p>4. Charitable deductions</p>\r\n              <p>When
        you''re pulling your records together, don''t forget any under-the-radar charitable
        write-offs. If you gave money to a qualified non-profit through automatic
        payroll deductions, it is deductible. So, too, is that pizza you bought for
        a homeless shelter and the miles you drove (at 14 cents a mile) to help a
        qualified charity do repair work in a Hurricane Sandy-ravaged location.</p>\r\n              <p>If
        you''re looking for information at the last minute, go through your credit
        card statements (log on to your bank online if you didn''t save them in hard
        copy) to search for forgotten charitable donations, and search your calendar
        to jog your memory.</p>\r\n              <p>5. Medical expenses</p>\r\n              <p>Not
        everyone will qualify to write off their medical expenses, but if your health
        costs were high relative to your income - either because your earnings were
        squeezed or because you had medical issues - it''s a valuable deduction. You
        have to itemize to take this deduction, and you qualify only if your medical
        costs go above 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income.</p>\r\n              <p>On
        the plus side: For tax purposes, medical expenses include a vast array of
        spending, from eyeglasses and hearing aids to travel to medical appointments
        (at 23 cents a mile), and even some long-term care insurance premiums.</p>\r\n              <p>To
        tally up all the year''s costs, review any records you kept, and then search
        through your credit card statements, your health insurance website to capture
        any co-pays that you might have paid for in cash and online prescription drug
        ordering history.</p>\r\n              <p>6. Capital gains, capital losses</p>\r\n              <p>The
        one bright spot to taking losses in this volatile market is that you''ll see
        some value at tax time. You can use those investment losses (including any
        \"tax loss carryforward\" rolled over from previous years) to offset your
        gains, and then take a $3,000 deduction against income.</p>\r\n              <p>Pay
        attention to the details: If you''ve been reinvesting dividends, you may need
        to account for the \"wash sale\" rule, in which capital losses are prohibited
        to the extent that you bought a similar stock or fund back too quickly.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        increased disclosure on \"cost basis\" (the purchase value of your investments
        for tax purposes) reported on the 1099 forms you received (and may have ignored)
        makes it easier to fill out your tax returns last minute.</p>\r\n              <p>If
        you find mistakes, though, you may need to file an extension in order to have
        time to sort out the issue with your broker before filing your return.</p>\r\n              <p>7.
        Extensions</p>\r\n              <p>If you just can''t get it together to get
        your tax return in on time, file for an extension to avoid the hefty penalties
        for late filing. It''s automatic, and it lasts for six months, until October
        15th. But caveat emptor: Getting an extension does not extend the time you
        have to pay your taxes, so if you think you''ll owe, it''s best to send a
        guesstimated payment to minimize any late-payment penalties.</p>\r\n              <p>8.
        Check your return and check it again</p>\r\n              <p>Taxpayers make
        all kinds of errors on their returns, from basic math (though tax software
        has generally cut down on those) to forgetting to claim your kids as dependents
        (or, perhaps worse, claiming them at the same time your former spouse does)
        to messing up Social Security numbers. Go over your return carefully. And
        if you do owe, make sure you''ve got the cash in your checking account to
        cover the payment. The last thing you want is for your check to the U.S. Treasury
        to bounce.</p>\r\n              <p>(The writer is a Reuters columnist. The

        Suzanne Barlyn</p>\r\n              <p>(Reuters) - Choosing professional liability
        insurance is often a daunting process for financial advisory firms, leading
        many to gloss over the fine print or skimp on coverage. That can prove to
        be a costly misstep.</p>\r\n              <p>Coverage limits and exceptions
        may be tricky to decipher. What''s more, steep premiums may tempt some firms
        to buy cheaper, less comprehensive coverage.</p>\r\n              <p>But making
        a mistake can ultimately leave brokerages and other investment advisory firms
        holding the bag for hefty legal expenses if problems with regulators crop
        up or clients sue.</p>\r\n              <p>A federal court ruling that recently
        went against David Lerner Associates, a New York-based brokerage, illustrates
        what could go wrong if a firm fails to line up proper coverage.</p>\r\n              <p>Judge
        Joseph Bianco of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York
        found that the firm''s policy from the Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Co
        did not cover claims stemming from performance of \"professional services,\"
        according to a March 29 opinion. The company is a unit of the Philadelphia
        Insurance Cos, which is owned by Tokio Marine Holdings Inc.</p>\r\n              <p>As
        a consequence, the court said the insurer had no obligation to pay for the
        firm''s legal defense in a class action lawsuit and separate regulatory action
        that led to a $12 million settlement to customers who bought into a $2 billion
        real estate investment trust.</p>\r\n              <p>In essence, the court
        said the Lerner firm''s responsibility to conduct due diligence on the REITs
        it sold - which regulators and plaintiffs said was not adequate - was a type
        of \"professional service\" excluded by the coverage. The insurance covered
        only misdeeds by company officials.</p>\r\n              <p>Philadelphia Indemnity
        declined to comment. A Lerner spokesman said the firm is considering whether
        to appeal.</p>\r\n              <p>It is uncertain whether Lerner misunderstood
        its policy or it was simply trying to save money. What''s clear is that many
        small brokerages face challenges when selecting coverage.</p>\r\n              <p>THE
        BASICS</p>\r\n              <p>Securities industry rules require brokerages
        to buy a fidelity bond, insurance that protects customer assets in limited
        circumstances, such as employee theft.</p>\r\n              <p>But it will
        not cover legal expenses for regulatory actions or rulings to pay customers
        in arbitration and court cases, said Joel Beck, a Lawrenceville, Georgia,
        lawyer who advises brokerages on regulatory issues.</p>\r\n              <p>That
        is when a type of policy known as errors and omissions coverage, or professional
        liability insurance, can help. While no policy is air-tight, some cover more
        than others.</p>\r\n              <p>Make no mistake, brokerages that commit
        fraud or illegal acts should not expect any slack. \"No one is going to insure
        you for your own deliberate conduct,\" said Matthew Farley, a lawyer for Drinker
        Biddle &amp; Reath LLP who advises brokerages on regulatory issues.</p>\r\n              <p>But
        other areas are less clear-cut, and sparring with an insurer in court after
        a firm rings up big legal fees is no way to determine what is covered. Legal
        defense bills for a regulatory enforcement action can set a firm back $500,000
        or more, say lawyers. And fighting a class-action can run into the millions
        - that does not even account for any damage awards.</p>\r\n              <p>Certain
        policies make a poor fit for some firms. They may exclude, for example, coverage
        for selling privately traded securities, said Jessica Thayer, senior vice
        president at Theodore Liftman Insurance Inc, a Boston-based insurance broker.</p>\r\n              <p>Brokerages
        may also need to ask insurers to change certain boilerplate language, Thayer
        said. The standard policy, for example, may not spell out that the insurance
        pays for defense costs through the final outcome of a legal proceeding. In
        many cases, insurers will agree, she said.</p>\r\n              <p>CHEAP IS
        DEAR</p>\r\n              <p>Some firms find insurance contracts so puzzling
        they decide to skip professional liability coverage altogether.</p>\r\n              <p>For
        other small brokerages - typically those with 100 brokers or less - high premiums
        and limits on coverage can deter them from buying insurance, said Frank Vento,
        head of the investment management practice for Marsh Inc, a global insurance
        broker and unit of Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos.</p>\r\n              <p>Premiums
        for $1 million of coverage - the minimum a firm should consider - vary depending
        on many factors but can run as high as $50,000 per year, said Vento. Even
        then, firms usually have to pick up the first $100,000 of legal defense costs.
        Some small brokerages are not able to get coverage, depending on factors such
        as previous insurance claims, Vento said.</p>\r\n              <p>Premiums
        generally cost less for registered investment advisers (RIAs), which typically
        charge a flat fee for services based on a client''s assets under management.</p>\r\n              <p>RIAs
        that manage $1 billion or less can pay under $20,000 a year for coverage because
        their work is typically less risky than selling individual securities, Vento
        said.</p>\r\n              <p>That''s because RIAs must recommend what is
        in their clients'' best interests, whereas brokers can recommend what is \"suitable\"
        based on factors such as risk tolerance and age. But what is \"suitable\"
        may not turn out to be best for clients, leading to more frequent claims against
        brokers, say lawyers.</p>\r\n              <p>Some smaller firms often cut
        corners by buying only a policy that covers misdeeds by the management, known
        as directors and officers liability insurance, instead of professional liability
        coverage for the firm''s actions, said Vento. But the potential savings of
        tens of thousands of dollars will not matter if coverage does not kick in
        when a problem crops up.</p>\r\n              <p>Last week''s court ruling
        against David Lerner Associates spotlights those limits. The firm had directors
        and officers insurance but not professional liability coverage for the matters
        at issue in its legal woes, its spokesman said.</p>\r\n              <p>(Reporting

        Andrew Torchia</p>\r\n              <p>DUBAI (Reuters) - Changing trading
        patterns and pressure to improve profit margins will boost the Gulf''s use
        of the Chinese yuan in coming years, the head of banking giant HSBC''s &lt;HSBA.L&gt;
        China operations said on Monday.</p>\r\n              <p>Gulf Arab countries
        have lagged many other parts of Asia in using the yuan because their oil exports
        to China are denominated in U.S. dollars and most of their currencies are
        pegged to the dollar.</p>\r\n              <p>HSBC estimates 10 percent of
        China''s international trade is conducted in yuan, a ratio which it expects
        will rise to 30 percent by 2015. The share is under 4 percent for Chinese
        trade with the United Arab Emirates, which imports many goods for on-shipment
        to other countries in the Gulf.</p>\r\n              <p>But Helen Wong, chief
        executive of HSBC China, said she was seeing growing interest within China
        in using the yuan instead of the dollar for non-oil trade with the Gulf.</p>\r\n              <p>A
        wider range of smaller Chinese companies are becoming involved with the Gulf,
        and in contrast to big state-owned firms which are accustomed to processing
        dollars, the smaller firms want to use the yuan to minimize costs and currency
        risk, she said.</p>\r\n              <p>\"Customers are telling us that they
        are willing to give discounts if the payment is in RMB,\" Wong said in an
        interview while visiting Dubai to promote HSBC''s yuan services to local businessmen.</p>\r\n              <p>Rising
        Chinese labor costs are also increasing interest in the yuan by compressing
        profit margins, making savings gained through the currency''s use more important,
        HSBC officials said.</p>\r\n              <p>The bank said on Monday it was
        launching yuan account services in Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Lebanon, allowing
        clients in those countries to settle cross-border trades and make term deposits
        in the currency. It was already offering the accounts in the UAE and Saudi
        Arabia.</p>\r\n              <p>TRADE GROWTH</p>\r\n              <p>Annual
        trade between China and the UAE has expanded sixteen fold since 2002 to $40.4
        billion, according to Chinese official data.</p>\r\n              <p>Last
        year there were initial signs that the Gulf''s interest in the yuan was moving
        beyond trade to fund-raising and investment; in March 2012 Emirates NBD &lt;ENBD.DU&gt;,
        Dubai''s biggest bank, issued the first yuan bond from the region.</p>\r\n              <p>Wong
        predicted an increasing flow of \"dim sum bonds\" in coming years, and said
        Dubai had the potential in the long term to become the Middle East''s center
        for yuan business.</p>\r\n              <p>One step was taken in January last
        year when the central banks of China and the United Arab Emirates signed an
        agreement allowing them to swap 35 billion yuan ($5.6 billion). The swap facility
        does not appear to have been used so far, bankers said, but will ensure liquidity
        if demand for the yuan rises.</p>\r\n              <p>A key step would be
        any decision by China to appoint banks to clear yuan trades in Dubai, as it
        has done for Taiwan and Singapore in the last few months.</p>\r\n              <p>\"Certainly
        the Middle East is a big enough region for it to operate its own clearing
        center,\" Wong said. But she added this would depend on factors such as the
        stance of UAE authorities and competition from London, a top global foreign
        exchange center, and there was no sign of this status being accorded now.</p>\r\n              <p>Even
        without clearing status, however, other innovations may spur yuan trade in
        Dubai. The Chinese central bank has said it will launch this year or next
        the China International Payment System, a facility to make yuan clearance
        more efficient for centers which lack their own clearing banks.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        new system would link Chinese and overseas banks, remaining open for most
        of the global day.</p>\r\n              <p>\"We see great potential for further
        growth\" in use of the yuan in the UAE, Zheng Yang, a senior official in the
        Chinese central bank''s Shanghai branch, told HSBC clients in a presentation
        on Monday. He was visiting the UAE for talks with officials and bankers.</p>\r\n              <p>(Reporting

        a volatile session higher on Monday as investors looked ahead to an earnings
        season expected to show modest growth despite concerns about macroeconomic
        conditions.</p>\r\n              <p>Wall Street fluctuated between positive
        and negative territory for much of the day before climbing in the final hour
        of trading, ending near its session highs. However, volume was light and the
        Dow''s gains were limited by a selloff of Johnson &amp; Johnson &lt;JNJ.N&gt;
        shares.</p>\r\n              <p>Forecasts for first-quarter earnings have
        been scaled back in 2013, with profits seen rising just 1.6 percent from the
        year-ago quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. In January, earnings
        were seen rising 4.3 percent.</p>\r\n              <p>The drop in expectations
        has come as economic figures suggest the recovery could be less robust than
        some had thought. Weak corporate results could give investors further reasons
        to sell, pushing both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 back from recent all-time
        closing highs.</p>\r\n              <p>\"We''re waiting for earnings for evidence
        that the market can be supported at these levels,\" said Jim Dunigan, chief
        investment officer at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia. \"We will see
        growth in earnings, but clearing the expectations bar could be difficult,
        which could give us reason to pause.\"</p>\r\n              <p>The season
        unofficially started after the market closed with results from Alcoa Inc &lt;AA.N&gt;.
        The stock rose 1.3 percent to $8.50 in extended-hours trading after adjusted
        earnings topped expectations.</p>\r\n              <p>As the first Dow component
        to report, Alcoa is informally viewed as setting the initial tone for the
        season, though many more bellwether companies'' earnings won''t come out until
        next week. The S&amp;P materials index &lt;.SPSMCM&gt; ended Monday''s session
        up 0.4 percent.</p>\r\n              <p>Among the day''s most active names,
        Advanced Micro Devices &lt;AMD.N&gt; jumped 13 percent to $2.59 as the S&amp;P
        500''s biggest percentage gainer, while Monster Beverage &lt;MNST.O&gt; rose
        4.7 percent to $52.01, helping boost the S&amp;P consumer staples sector index
        &lt;.SPLRCS&gt;, which rose 1.1 percent.</p>\r\n              <p>On the downside,
        J&amp;J fell 1.1 percent to $81.11 after JPMorgan downgraded the healthcare
        company''s stock to \"neutral\" from \"overweight,\" saying it faced \"a messy
        first quarter and a likely downward revision to 2013 guidance.\"</p>\r\n              <p>The
        Dow Jones industrial average &lt;.DJI&gt; was up 48.15 points, or 0.33 percent,

        whose homes were in foreclosure in 2009 or 2010 can expect to receive between
        $300 and $125,000 under settlements reached between top banks and U.S. regulators
        earlier this year.</p>\r\n              <p>The payments, the majority of which
        fall in the $300 to $600 range, will begin going out on Friday, the Federal
        Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said on Tuesday.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        agreements with 13 mortgage servicers, including units of Bank of America
        Corp &lt;BAC.N&gt;, Citigroup Inc &lt;C.N&gt;, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co &lt;JPM.N&gt;,
        Wells Fargo &amp; Co &lt;WFC.N&gt;, provided $3.6 billion in cash payments
        to borrowers who were at any stage of the foreclosure process at the height
        of the housing crisis.</p>\r\n              <p>Although regulators entered
        into the settlements in January, at the time they only provided estimates
        of what borrowers might expect to receive.</p>\r\n              <p>The settlements
        were designed to end a case-by-case review of past foreclosures, since those
        reviews proved slow and expensive, with some $2 billion going to consultants
        who conducted the reviews before any money had been paid out to eligible borrowers.</p>\r\n              <p>On
        Tuesday the agencies said 1,082 borrowers who were active duty members of
        the military had foreclosures completed on their homes and would receive $125,000
        each. About 50 borrowers who were not in default but had their homes seized
        will also receive the top $125,000 payout.</p>\r\n              <p>The largest
        numbers of borrowers, around 3 million, will receive between $300 and $600,
        with many of the larger payouts going to borrowers, who had requested reviews
        under the case-by-case reviews.</p>\r\n              <p>A total of 4.2 million
        borrowers are eligible to receive payments, and checks to 1.4 million of them
        will be sent out on Friday, regulators said.</p>\r\n              <p>For a
        full breakdown of the payments, go to: http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/bcreg20130409a1.pdf</p>\r\n              <p>The
        numbers do not yet include borrowers whose mortgages were serviced by units
        of Morgan Stanley &lt;MS.N&gt; or Goldman Sachs &lt;GS.N&gt;, and regulators
        said they would release those numbers in the near future.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        payment announcement provides regulators with some good news ahead of a hearing
        scheduled on Thursday before a Senate Banking subcommittee, during which lawmakers
        are expected to criticize OCC and Fed officials for what they believe was
        an opaque and mismanaged review process.</p>\r\n              <p>Senator Elizabeth
        Warren and Representative Elijah Cummings have pressured the agencies to turn
        over more information about how they monitored the reviews and how consultants
        came to receive such vast sums.</p>\r\n              <p>(Reporting by Aruna

        James Saft</p>\r\n              <p>(Reuters) - The Bank of Japan''s massive
        new bid for inflation will create growth but to its chagrin much of it may
        well be concentrated in financial markets and outside of Japan.</p>\r\n              <p>So
        long as Japanese consumers remained convinced that the new program will bring
        more inflation in what they buy rather than in what they earn, much of the
        benefit will be felt in Europe, the U.S. and the other economies into which
        the newly minted money will actually leak.</p>\r\n              <p>The BOJ
        last week vowed to spend $1.4 trillion in less than two years buying up bonds
        and assets in a bid to hit its avowed 2.0 percent inflation goal. The central
        bank will create money and wade into markets, vacuuming up Japanese government
        debt and other assets while targeting the amount of money in the economy rather
        than the rate of interest at which it will make loans.</p>\r\n              <p>While
        this is a step change in scale, the logic behind the plan is no different
        than the monetary policies followed over most of the past two decades in Japan,
        policies notable mostly for their lack of success. To break the self-reinforcing
        spiral of falling prices, wages and output, the BOJ must convince businesses
        and households that cash spent or invested today will buy more than that tucked
        away for tomorrow.</p>\r\n              <p>By any standard this is a big plan,
        roughly three times the size of U.S. quantitative easing relative to the size
        of Japan''s government bond issuance.</p>\r\n              <p>The question
        is where the money goes. Clearly the BOJ is already having a big impact on
        global markets, with the yen continuing to fall in value and Japanese government
        bond interest rates declining in sometimes frenetic and disorderly trading.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        problem is in the pessimism entrenched in Japanese consumers'' thinking process
        after a generation of deflation and economic stagnation.</p>\r\n              <p>A
        survey released by the BOJ last week showed that almost three-quarters of
        households expect prices to rise a year from now, the most since 2008. On
        the surface, this looks like a great victory for monetary policy. Households,
        seeing inflation, surely will part with money?</p>\r\n              <p>Not
        necessarily. First off, expectations for rising prices are concentrated on
        the kinds of things which households must buy, notably food and energy. When
        it comes to durable goods, in other words the things one can choose not to
        buy, the expectation is still for falling prices in real terms.</p>\r\n              <p>Even
        worse, only 9.5 percent expect their own wages to keep pace with inflation.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        clear implication is that the money won''t move, because households will cut
        back on spending to protect themselves from the rising cost of essentials.</p>\r\n              <p>That
        might possibly change if Japanese businesses start hiking wages, but while
        newly aggressive monetary policy may drive the yen down and make exports more
        competitive, it does nothing to improve Japan''s poor allocation of capital
        and development of products.</p>\r\n              <p>THE GREAT LEAK</p>\r\n              <p>As
        with QE in the U.S., the real place to look for the impact of central bank
        action is in financial markets.</p>\r\n              <p>The BOJ will succeed
        in driving down the value of the yen and rate of interest on Japanese bonds.
        That is good for exporters, but bad for the many investors who depend on income.
        It will also drive up the price of stocks, at least in part as savers take
        on more risk.</p>\r\n              <p>If the great printing of money doesn''t
        do much to move money around Japan''s domestic economy, that money will sit
        on deposit at banks, insurance companies and pension funds, all of which will
        have to decide what to do with it.</p>\r\n              <p>Many, inevitably,
        will become increasingly desperate for extra yield and will choose to take
        risks by investing in overseas bond markets which offer higher returns, though
        also the additional risk of currency moves.</p>\r\n              <p>That will
        help to drive down interest rates in places like France, the United States
        and emerging markets like Brazil. This will be especially welcome in the euro
        zone, and may go some way to explaining why there has been so little criticism
        of Japanese policy outside of Asia.</p>\r\n              <p>A more committed
        Bank of Japan may have trouble defeating deflation, but will support riskier
        markets. Investors in high-yield bonds and equities alike will see prices
        supported by what should be a steady flow of money out of Japan and into just
        about anything but Japan.</p>\r\n              <p>In some ways this is all
        reasonably good news. More money printing will help Japan a bit, and is generally
        stimulative everywhere.</p>\r\n              <p>The real issue is the sustained,
        and widening, disconnection between financial markets and the world''s real
        economies.</p>\r\n              <p>Japan may well be looking at a bull market
        but searching in vain for a recovering economy.</p>\r\n              <p>(James

        indexes swung between gains and losses in early trading. Forecasts for U.S.
        first-quarter earnings have been scaled back in 2013, with profits seen rising
        just 1.6 percent from the year-ago quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.
        In January, earnings were seen rising 4.3 percent.</p>\r\n              <p>While
        analysts said the low bar could mean some companies might handily beat expectations,
        Wall Street is also vulnerable to a pullback after this year''s rally that
        has pushed stocks to record highs.</p>\r\n              <p>But the liquidity
        stemming from the Federal Reserve''s ultra-loose monetary policy means stocks
        will see more of a \"rolling correction\" among sectors than a large sell-off,
        said Dan Veru, chief investment officer at Palisade Capital Management LLC
        in Fort Lee, New Jersey.</p>\r\n              <p>\"I''m expecting us to be

        Kim Dixon</p>\r\n              <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack
        Obama on Wednesday revived a list of his favorite tax ideas, hoping to raise
        $580 billion in new revenues from the wealthy over a decade in a potential
        opening gambit to forge a deal with Congress to overhaul the U.S. tax code.</p>\r\n              <p>While
        certain not to move forward en masse, his 2014 budget blueprint has elements
        likely to spur discussion, including a proposal to tax derivatives more stringently,
        as lawmakers weigh a revamp of the tax code and face a deadline on the government''s
        debt limit this summer.</p>\r\n              <p>\"These are all opening bids
        in any potential grand bargain, so from that perspective they are important,\"
        said Chris Krueger, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners.</p>\r\n              <p>Congressional
        Republicans largely blasted the Democratic president''s budget proposal, highlighting
        the difficulty policymakers have had forging a long-term deficit-cutting plan.</p>\r\n              <p>Obama''s
        budget does not seek to raise individual tax rates as he has proposed in prior
        budgets. For years, he sought to raise rates on household income above $250,000.</p>\r\n              <p>Obama
        came to a deal with Republicans during last year''s fiscal cliff battle that
        raised rates for households earning more than $450,000 a year, to 39.6 percent
        from 35 percent.</p>\r\n              <p>A senior administration official
        said on Wednesday the White House preferred not to \"re-litigate\" that fight.</p>\r\n              <p>Obama''s
        budget also proposes a new \"Buffett tax,\" named for investor Warren Buffett,
        that phases in a minimum 30 percent tax rate on household income above $1
        million.</p>\r\n              <p>The bid revives Obama''s offer last year
        to Republican House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner during the talks
        to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff of looming tax hikes.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        White House renewed a longstanding proposal to cap itemized deductions and
        exemptions among wealthier taxpayers - starting at household income of roughly
        $250,000. A phased-in limit on deductions is now part of the tax code for
        more affluent taxpayers.</p>\r\n              <p>The new cap would apply to
        the same list of breaks proposed in years past, including the charitable tax
        break and the exemption for municipal bond interest.</p>\r\n              <p>Boehner
        last year said he could back raising new revenue through curbing deductions,
        though he now rules out new revenue.</p>\r\n              <p>One battle Obama
        proposed to fight again is over the estate tax, pitching to raise it to 45
        percent for estates worth over $3.5 million, after a deal to cap it in January
        at 40 percent for estates over $5 million.</p>\r\n              <p>The budget
        also ends a tax break for \"carried interest\" profits earned by fund managers
        like those who run private equity and other investment firms, officials said.</p>\r\n              <p>New
        tax ideas, which officials previewed last week, include boosting the cigarette
        tax and a $3 million cap on tax-deferred individual retirement account contributions.</p>\r\n              <p>In
        a bid to attract Republicans, Obama proposed changing the inflation calculation
        for Social Security benefits to help shore up the finances of the public pension
        program, which would raise revenue and curb benefits.</p>\r\n              <p>That
        proposal also would push people more quickly into higher tax categories, as
        their income rises faster than the brackets are adjusted.</p>\r\n              <p>CORPORATE
        BREAKS A TARGET</p>\r\n              <p>Top tax-writers in Congress are working
        on a tax rewrite, but the process is fraught with disagreement over details
        and whether to raise new revenue in the process.</p>\r\n              <p>Prominent
        in the budget are proposals to raise hundreds of billions of dollars from
        U.S. multinational corporations that avert tax on income held overseas. Obama
        seeks to raise about $157 billion over a decade with these measures, up about
        $10 billion from last year''s budget.</p>\r\n              <p>These include
        limiting the ability of corporations to defer tax on foreign income and tightening
        foreign tax credit rules.</p>\r\n              <p>Obama also sought more revenue
        by curbing energy tax breaks, and proposed ending a tax advantage for corporate
        jets.</p>\r\n              <p>Michael Mundaca, who was Obama''s top tax official
        in the Treasury Department during his first term, said a reprise of earlier
        proposals is not surprising.</p>\r\n              <p>\"It doesn''t mean the
        administration is not open to a deal,\" Mundaca, co-director of national tax
        at Ernst &amp; Young, said before the budget came out. \"It is just that they
        may not be going to negotiate through the budget.\"</p>\r\n              <p>There
        were a few areas of potential agreement with Republicans. Obama again pitched
        changing the taxation of derivatives to mark them to a market price yearly
        for taxation purposes, which he says will raise $19 billion over a decade.</p>\r\n              <p>That
        proposal largely mirrors one put forward by House Ways and Means Committee
        Chairman Dave Camp.</p>\r\n              <p>But Camp''s idea is just part
        of a plan to dramatically cut individual tax rates, something most Democrats
        have not signed onto.</p>\r\n              <p>The cuts to corporate breaks
        are counterbalanced by White House proposals to double a tax credit for small
        start-up companies and extend a business research and development tax credit.
        Obama also wants to expand a child care tax credit used by less wealthy individuals.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        president has backed cutting the top U.S. corporate tax rate to 28 percent
        from 35 percent, now the highest in the industrialized world. But most companies
        do not pay the top rate after taking advantage of numerous tax breaks.</p>\r\n              <p>(Editing

        YORK (Reuters) - Chinese import data propelled stock markets around the world
        higher on Wednesday, with two benchmark U.S. indexes closing at records, while
        Japan''s economic stimulus package continued to weigh on the yen, sending
        it to multi-year lows against the dollar and euro.</p>\r\n              <p>U.S.
        stock sentiment was eroded early by the Federal Reserve''s premature release
        of the minutes of its last policy-setting meeting, but that was quickly ignored
        by most investors.</p>\r\n              <p>Instead, economic data from China
        set the mostly positive tone throughout the global trading day. Imports of
        key commodities rebounded in March, signaling rising domestic demand to drive
        the world''s second-largest economy.</p>\r\n              <p>\"This is two
        pieces of Chinese economic data in a row that have proven positive,\" said
        Art Hogan, managing director of Lazard Capital Markets in New York. Data on
        Tuesday showed annual consumer inflation in China cooled last month.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        Dow Jones industrial average &lt;.DJI&gt; ended up 128.78 points, or 0.88
        percent, at 14,802.24. The Standard &amp; Poor''s 500 Index &lt;.SPX&gt; was
        up 19.12 points, or 1.22 percent, at 1,587.73. The Nasdaq Composite Index
        &lt;.IXIC&gt; was up 59.40 points, or 1.83 percent, at 3,297.25.</p>\r\n              <p>For
        the second day in a row, cyclical shares advanced as investors bought into
        the sector, which has lagged other sectors recently. As these groups are closely
        tied to the pace of economic growth, many investors viewed the advance as
        a sign that the market''s rally has staying power.</p>\r\n              <p>Financial
        shares helped lead the advance, with the S&amp;P financial sector index &lt;.SPSY&gt;
        gaining 1.2 percent, while the S&amp;P information technology sector index
        &lt;.SPLRCT&gt; rose 1.8 percent.</p>\r\n              <p>The unexpected release
        of the Fed policy minutes briefly rattled investors. But after digesting the
        report, they viewed it as of lesser importance than the Chinese data.</p>\r\n              <p>Indeed,
        since the minutes indicated stimulus remains in place for now, they may even
        have helped U.S. stocks in the short term.</p>\r\n              <p>A few U.S.
        Federal Reserve policymakers expected to taper the pace of asset purchases
        by mid-year and end them later this year, while several others expected to
        slow the pace a bit later and halt the quantitative easing program by year-end,
        according to the minutes of the Fed''s March meeting.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        MSCI all-world share index, &lt;.MIWD00000PUS&gt;, which tracks stocks in
        45 countries, rose 1.2 percent to its highest level since March 18. The percentage
        gain on the index was the second best of 2013.</p>\r\n              <p>Europe''s
        FTSEurofirst 300 index &lt;.FTEU3&gt; was up 1.8 percent.</p>\r\n              <p>YEN
        WEAKENS</p>\r\n              <p>In the currency markets, the yen hit a more
        than three-year low against the euro and edged closer to 100 to the dollar
        as it extended a slide triggered by the Bank of Japan''s massive monetary
        easing plan unveiled last Thursday.</p>\r\n              <p>But the same stimulus
        measure was a boon for Japanese stocks. Japan''s Nikkei index &lt;.N225&gt;
        ended up 0.7 percent, at its highest close since August 2008.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        euro is being supported by speculation that Japanese investors, looking for
        higher returns as the BOJ action depresses domestic yields, may turn to euro
        zone bonds.</p>\r\n              <p>The dollar was bid as the Fed minutes
        were seen as maintaining the bias to end measures to stoke economic growth.</p>\r\n              <p>\"Once
        again, the minutes have sounded a slightly more hawkish tone and that''s really
        what''s benefiting dollar/yen,\" said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
        Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.</p>\r\n              <p>The euro
        was up 0.7 percent against the yen at 130.36 yen, while the dollar was up
        0.8 percent against the yen at 99.78 yen. The yen touched a four-year low
        against the dollar.</p>\r\n              <p>YIELD HUNT</p>\r\n              <p>The
        prospect of huge purchases of Japanese government bonds by the BOJ is seen
        as likely to send investors on a hunt for higher returns in assets denominated
        in currencies other than the rapidly weakening yen.</p>\r\n              <p>Japanese
        government bond futures fell sharply on Wednesday, prompting the Tokyo Stock
        Exchange to halt trading briefly while the 10-year cash bond yield rose to
        a four-week high.</p>\r\n              <p>However, highly rated euro zone
        bond yields, which have fallen on the hopes of Japanese demand, recovered
        from their recent lows.</p>\r\n              <p>U.S. Treasury note yields

        Beth Pinsker</p>\r\n              <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Looking to buy a
        home? Figuring out how much house you can afford is about to get more complicated
        as the housing market emerges from crisis.</p>\r\n              <p>Right now,
        market conditions are almost ideal for those who have the income to buy, because
        interest rates are low and while home prices are rising, they are coming off
        significant lows. But these ideal terms apply only to those who buy now and
        plan to stay in a house for 30 years, with a fixed-rate mortgage.</p>\r\n              <p>For
        those who are just thinking about buying, who are considering adjustable mortgages
        or who might move within the 7-year average ownership period, they could end
        up back in the same trouble that caused the 2008 housing crisis.</p>\r\n              <p>If
        interest rates rise - and since they are still at historic lows, most forecasts
        say they eventually will - houses will be less affordable, according to data
        from real estate site Zillow.com and the Home Affordability Index of the National
        Association of Realtors reveals. As a result, buyers must consider more than
        just income relative to cost in calculating how much of a mortgage they can
        afford.</p>\r\n              <p>In fact, there could be significant volatility
        in the coming years, predicts Stan Humphries, chief economist for Zillow,
        noting that as soon as mortgage rates creep up, homes will seem more expensive
        and prices will drop again.</p>\r\n              <p>\"My concern is that people
        will be induced to buy now on sale, and then if prices go down in some markets
        in a year or two because interest rates go up, they could be in a real pickle,\"
        he said.</p>\r\n              <p>PAYING LESS</p>\r\n              <p>American
        homeowners are paying significantly less of their monthly income toward mortgage
        payments than they did in the pre-bubble years of 1985 to 1999, according
        to a new study by Zillow.com. They are paying a mere 12.6 percent, down from
        19.9 percent in the pre-bubble time frame. During the period before 2000,
        interest rates ranged from 6 to 13 percent.</p>\r\n              <p>At the
        same time, Zillow''s price-to-income ratio, which measures how much a house
        costs relative to a person''s income, is almost back to pre-bubble levels.
        During the tumultuous period from 2000 to 2011, all of these numbers rose
        quickly, peaked in 2006 and have since been falling.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        data suggests that the time has not passed for homes to be a good buy because
        they are still very affordable.</p>\r\n              <p>Zillow.com is not
        alone in suggesting it is still a uniquely favorable time for home buyers.
        Nor is it alone in suggesting the window is not likely to stay open much longer.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        average family has twice the income needed to purchase the typical home with
        a 20 percent down payment, according to The Home Affordability Index of the
        National Association of Realtors. The current reading of 206.2 is the third-highest
        level ever, well above a reading of 100 that means the same family would have
        exactly the right amount to buy the average home.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        NAR data also shows incomes rising slightly, while Zillow''s shows them stagnant
        or slightly down.</p>\r\n              <p>Historically, this average is somewhere
        in the middle, says Danielle Hale, director of housing statistics for the
        NAR.</p>\r\n              <p>Today''s high ratio is helping the market recover,
        but Hale notes that as prices come back and mortgage rates rise, she expects
        affordability will return to lower levels.</p>\r\n              <p>\"At this
        point, even if house prices stay steady, and incomes stay the same, if interest
        rates go up, affordability would go down,\" says Hale.</p>\r\n              <p>WHAT
        CAN YOU AFFORD</p>\r\n              <p>For those sitting in front of a home
        affordability calculator, dreaming of buying a new home, these forecasts should
        alter your math.</p>\r\n              <p>\"Affordability is based upon the
        house you''re buying today, not the house in 10 years,\" cautions Greg McBride,
        senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com, which provides many financial calculators.
        \"Unless you''re forecasting skills are spot-on, the calculator is not designed
        to help under that scenario.\"</p>\r\n              <p>The typical calculator
        measures your income, the size of the mortgage and the interest rate to see
        what monthly payments you can afford. But buyers can get in trouble if they
        adjust these parameters to get the outcome they want, says McBride, noting
        that is how owners ended up with more house than they could afford or adjustable
        interest rates that ballooned their payments during the housing bubble.</p>\r\n              <p>Humphries
        urges people to be conservative when entering their information, especially
        if they are not buying with a fixed-rate mortgage and might sell any time
        in the near future.</p>\r\n              <p>For those who think they might
        move in a few years, he says to ask, \"Is this still a good decision if I
        thought prices were not going to rise?\"</p>\r\n              <p>But that
        does not mean Humphries does not encourage people to buy now.</p>\r\n              <p>\"For
        any buyer who will be in for a long period of time, it''s like homes are on
        sale right now,\" he says. \"But the implication is that if you want to get
        it while the getting''s good, get it now. Homes will look expensive in a few
        years if interest rates go up.\"</p>\r\n              <p>(Follow us @ReutersMoney

        Ryan Vlastelica</p>\r\n              <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks climbed
        1 percent on Wednesday, with both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 ending at historic
        highs as cyclical shares led the way higher for a second straight day.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        S&amp;P 500 finally joined the new all-time intraday high club, surging past
        a record set on October 11, 2007. The index has struggled to breach the level
        of 1,576.09 for the past several weeks, but broke above it on Wednesday to
        rise as high as 1,589.07. The Dow also hit another intraday milestone, rising
        as high as 14,826.66.</p>\r\n              <p>\"The path of least resistance
        for the market remains higher, and despite some mixed economic data, investors
        are concluding that stocks remain a better place to be than risk-free assets,\"
        said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Chicago-based Northern Trust
        Global Investments, which has about $760 billion in assets under management.</p>\r\n              <p>Gains
        were broad, with all but two of the S&amp;P 500''s 10 primary sectors up more
        than 1 percent. More than three-fourths of stocks traded on the Nasdaq ended
        higher, while 73 percent of New York Stock Exchange-listed shares did.</p>\r\n              <p>In
        another encouraging sign, volume was higher than it has been recently, with
        about 6.24 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the
        Nasdaq and NYSE MKT. However, volume remained below the daily average so far
        this year of about 6.36 billion shares.</p>\r\n              <p>With the day''s
        gains, major indexes are up about 10 percent for the year, but many investors
        viewed the strength in cyclicals - groups closely tied to the pace of economic
        growth - as a sign that the rally still has staying power. The Dow Jones Transportation
        Average &lt;.DJT&gt;, viewed as a leading indicator for the broader market,
        rose 1.8 percent.</p>\r\n              <p>Tech was the day''s strongest group,
        with the S&amp;P technology sector index &lt;.SPLRCT&gt; up 1.8 percent. The
        group was lifted by strong results at Adtran Inc &lt;ADTN.O&gt;, which jumped
        14 percent to $22.46 and boosted the shares of its peer companies. JDS Uniphase
        Corp &lt;JDSU.O&gt; added 4.9 percent to $13.99 while Juniper Networks Inc
        &lt;JNPR.N&gt; rose 4.7 percent to $18.84.</p>\r\n              <p>The sector
        also got a boost from Facebook Inc &lt;FB.O&gt;, which jumped 3.7 percent
        to $27.57.</p>\r\n              <p>The Dow Jones industrial average &lt;.DJI&gt;
        jumped 128.78 points, or 0.88 percent, to 14,802.24 at the close. The Standard
        &amp; Poor''s 500 Index &lt;.SPX&gt; climbed 19.12 points, or 1.22 percent,
        to 1,587.73. The Nasdaq Composite Index &lt;.IXIC&gt; shot up 59.40 points,
        or 1.83 percent, to close at 3,297.25.</p>\r\n              <p>The day marked
        the best session for both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 since February 27, and
        the best for the Nasdaq since January 2. The Nasdaq climbed to a session high
        of 3,299.15, its highest since November 2000.</p>\r\n              <p>\"After
        we broke above the high, we saw momentum accelerate as investors saw it as
        a release of resistance,\" said Katie Stockton, chief market technician at
        MKM Partners in Greenwich, Connecticut. \"By definition, there is no more
        resistance for the S&amp;P now that we''re at new highs.\"</p>\r\n              <p>The
        CBOE Volatility index &lt;.VIX&gt;, a measure of investor anxiety, fell 3.7
        percent.</p>\r\n              <p>Stockton added that if the S&amp;P 500 held
        above its old high, \"the next target would be 1,780.\"</p>\r\n              <p>The
        Federal Reserve unexpectedly released the minutes from its most recent policy-setting
        meeting five hours early. The minutes showed a few policymakers expected to
        taper the pace of asset purchases by mid-year and end them later this year,
        while several others expected to slow the pace a bit later and halt the quantitative
        easing program by year-end.</p>\r\n              <p>Accommodative monetary
        policy from the Fed has been credited with helping to boost equity prices,
        and uncertainty surrounding the minutes briefly hit indexes in the premarket
        session, though they subsequently recovered.</p>\r\n              <p>\"The
        only way quantitative easing will be tapered off is if the labor market shows
        noticeable improvement, and the most recent data doesn''t show that,\" said
        Northern Trust''s McDonald, referring to the March payroll report, which fell
        sharply short of expectations.</p>\r\n              <p>\"QE will only be taken
        away when we''re in a self-sustaining recovery. We''re not there yet, which
        points to the Fed continuing to stimulate the economy.\"</p>\r\n              <p>Among
        the 5 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results so far,
        almost three-quarters have topped expectations, according to Thomson Reuters
        data.</p>\r\n              <p>But quarterly profits are expected to grow just
        1.5 percent from a year ago, down from a January estimate of 4.3 percent.

        Lucia Mutikani</p>\r\n              <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of
        Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected
        last week, easing fears of a marked deterioration in labor market conditions
        after a surprise stumble in job growth in March.</p>\r\n              <p>Initial
        claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 42,000 to a seasonally adjusted
        346,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday, unwinding a jump in the prior
        week that appeared related to difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal
        variations.</p>\r\n              <p>It was the largest weekly drop since mid-November.
        Economists, who had expected first-time applications for jobless aid to fall
        only to 365,000, said the decline suggested the sharp slowdown in employment
        growth in March was an aberration.</p>\r\n              <p>\"We will see more
        job creation this month than we did in March and today''s jobless claims numbers
        are consistent with that expectation,\" said Robert Dye, chief economist at
        Comerica in Dallas.</p>\r\n              <p>Employers added only 88,000 workers
        to payrolls in March - the fewest in nine months - after a solid 268,000 increase
        in February.</p>\r\n              <p>Economists said the claims data suggested
        the slowdown in job creation reflected seasonal hiring being brought forward
        rather than underlying weakness in the labor market.</p>\r\n              <p>\"All
        the March employment report provided a hint of is that jobs that normally
        would have got hired in March, some of them got hired earlier in February,\"
        said Michael Strauss, chief economist at Commonfund in Wilton, Connecticut.</p>\r\n              <p>\"Seasonal
        hiring occurred a little bit earlier. The construction sector, for example,
        was so strong. This claims data supports that as well.\"</p>\r\n              <p>Jobless
        claims are now back at the lower end of their range for this year, suggesting
        the labor market recovery remains on track.</p>\r\n              <p>The report
        handed U.S. stocks their fourth straight day of gains, with the Dow Jones
        industrial average &lt;.DJI&gt; and the Standard &amp; Poor''s 500 index &lt;.SPX&gt;
        scaling fresh all-time highs.</p>\r\n              <p>The dollar hit a new
        four-year high against the Japanese yen, while U.S. Treasury debt prices rose
        modestly.</p>\r\n              <p>EASTER, SPRING BREAKS HEADACHE</p>\r\n              <p>Differences
        in the timing of Easter and school spring breaks, which likely threw off the
        model used to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations, had been blamed for
        the spike in claims during the week ended March 30.</p>\r\n              <p>A
        Labor Department analyst said no states had been estimated and there was nothing
        unusual in the state-level data for the latest week. He noted, however, that
        the floating Easter holiday and spring breaks continued to pose challenges
        for the so-called seasonal factor.</p>\r\n              <p>The seasonal distortions
        in the data will probably remain over the next few weeks.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market
        trends, increased 3,000 to 358,000. It remains close to a level economists
        normally associate with payroll gains of about 150,000 per month.</p>\r\n              <p>\"My
        sense is that the economy is generating on an average basis somewhere around
        180,000 to 190,000 jobs a month,\" said Dye. \"I do think that is enough to
        slowly bring the unemployment rate down and provide enough lift to households
        to help them feel some increase in disposable income.\"</p>\r\n              <p>Separate
        data suggested weak job growth last month hurt retail sales, but some executives
        expected business to pick up a bit in April. Several retailers, including
        Costco Wholesale Corp &lt;COST.O&gt; and T.J. Maxx parent TJX Cos Inc &lt;TJX.N&gt;,
        reported weaker-than-expected March sales.</p>\r\n              <p>The nation''s
        13 top retailers, including TJX Cos and Gap Inc &lt;GPS.N&gt;, were expected
        to report a 1.8 percent rise in same-store sales for March, according to Thomson
        Reuters, down from an increase of 2.9 percent a year earlier.</p>\r\n              <p>Economists
        are keeping a close eye on jobless claims data for signs of layoffs related
        to $85 billion in government budget cuts known as the \"sequester.\" Opinion
        is divided on what impact the spending cuts will have on the labor market.</p>\r\n              <p>Claims
        are also on the radar of the Federal Reserve, which has tied U.S. monetary
        policy to the labor market.</p>\r\n              <p>Minutes of its March 19-20
        meeting released on Wednesday showed the U.S. central bank was moving closer
        to ending its monthly $85 billion purchases of mortgage and Treasury bonds
        to keep rates low and spur faster job growth.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        meeting was held before the release of March''s weak employment report.</p>\r\n              <p>A
        Reuters survey released on Thursday forecast the unemployment rate averaging
        7.6 percent this year. The jobless rate dropped a tenth of a percentage point
        to 7.6 percent in March, but that was due to people leaving the labor force.</p>\r\n              <p>A
        second report from the Labor Department showed little sign of inflation, which
        should allow the Fed to keep policy very accommodative. Import prices slipped
        0.5 percent last month after rising 0.6 percent in February.</p>\r\n              <p>In
        the 12 months to March, import prices dropped 2.7 percent. Prices last month
        were subdued by a drop in the cost of petroleum and a strong dollar.</p>\r\n              <p>\"If
        inflation fears are the primary worry of those members who want to scale things
        back, well for now, they have little to be concerned about,\" said Joel Naroff,

        Herbert Lash</p>\r\n              <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - World equity markets
        rallied for a fourth day on Thursday, lifted by a surprise drop in Americans
        seeking unemployment benefits last week, while crude fell on a cut in global
        demand forecasts as U.S. oil supplies hit a two-decade high.</p>\r\n              <p>Japan''s
        aggressive monetary easing and signs of a growing recovery in China also lifted
        equity markets, with the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 stock indexes setting new
        closing record highs.</p>\r\n              <p>The 42,000 drop in initial claims
        for state unemployment benefits to a seasonally adjusted 346,000 could ease
        fears of a marked deterioration in U.S. labor market conditions after a surprise
        stumble in job growth in March.</p>\r\n              <p>\"This data is especially
        welcome on the heels of last week''s jobs report, and it just adds to the
        tremendous demand that there continues to be for equities,\" said Leo Grohowski,
        chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in New York.</p>\r\n              <p>\"The
        money that has been waiting for a pullback is running out of patience,\" he
        said.</p>\r\n              <p>Adding to investor optimism was an improved
        forecast from retail executives and analysts for same-store sales in April
        after last month''s ho-hum start to spring due to cold weather.</p>\r\n              <p>Wall
        Street rose despite news of a 14 percent plunge in personal computer sales
        in the first quarter, the sharpest drop in two decades of record-keeping,
        which pulled down shares of Microsoft Corp. &lt;MSFT.O&gt;, Hewlett-Packard
        Co &lt;HPQ.N&gt; and Intel Corp. &lt;INTC.O&gt;, among other technology-related
        issues.</p>\r\n              <p>The plunge marks a milestone in the apparent
        ebbing of the PC age as computing goes mobile via tablets and smartphones.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        Dow Jones industrial average &lt;.DJI&gt; closed up 62.90 points, or 0.42
        percent, at 14,865.14. The Standard &amp; Poor''s 500 Index &lt;.SPX&gt; rose
        5.64 points, or 0.36 percent, at 1,593.37. The Nasdaq Composite Index &lt;.IXIC&gt;
        gained 2.90 points, or 0.09 percent, at 3,300.16.</p>\r\n              <p>MSCI''s
        all-country world index &lt;.MIWD00000PUS&gt; rose 0.62 percent, a day after
        posting its second-best gain of the year.</p>\r\n              <p>European
        shares rose on bumper gains for asset managers, which benefited from this
        year''s equity rally lifted financial stocks.</p>\r\n              <p>Fund
        managers and traders said even if there were a pull-back, it would not be
        enough to stop European equity markets from gradually rising higher over the
        course of the year.</p>\r\n              <p>The FTSEurofirst 300 index &lt;.FTEU3&gt;
        of leading regional shares closed up 0.56 percent at 1,192.87.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        euro zone''s blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 &lt;.STOXX50E&gt; advanced 0.5 percent
        to 2,674.33.</p>\r\n              <p>Italian and Spanish government bond yields
        crept higher as investors took profits on recent gains in lower-rated debt,
        which has been driven by demand for yield in an easy monetary policy environment.</p>\r\n              <p>Since
        the Bank of Japan unveiled its radical stimulus program a week ago, the dollar
        has gained a whopping 7 percent, yields on major government bonds have fallen
        and MSCI''s world equity index has hit levels last seen in June 2008.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        latest gains in equities have been helped by evidence of an economic recovery
        in China - notably signs of growing domestic demand and easier credit - and
        by indications from the European Central Bank last week that it may cut rates.</p>\r\n              <p>\"The
        stronger-than-expected Japanese liquidity surge has led us to reassess our
        views on risky assets,\" said Salman Ahmed, fixed income strategist at Lombard
        Odier Investment Managers.</p>\r\n              <p>The benchmark 10-year U.S.
        Treasury note was up 4/32 in price to yield 1.7913 percent.</p>\r\n              <p>Brent
        crude oil fell below $105 per barrel, not far above an eight-month low, after
        analysts cut forecasts for global oil demand growth and U.S. crude oil stocks
        increased to their highest in more than two decades.</p>\r\n              <p>Brent
        futures for May delivery settled down $1.52 at $104.27 a barrel. U.S. crude
        futures fell $1.13 to settle at $93.51 a barrel.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        dollar hovered close to a four-year high against the yen, with gains above
        the key 100 yen level highly expected given the massive amount of bonds the
        Bank of Japan plans to buy to buoy its economy.</p>\r\n              <p>While
        the pace of the rally has slowed due to option barriers at 100 yen, most analysts
        believe it is only a matter of time until that mark is reached.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        dollar has not risen above 100 yen since April 2009.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        dollar was up 0.06 percent at 99.83 yen.</p>\r\n              <p>&lt;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>\r\n              <p>U.S.

        Chrystia Freeland</p>\r\n              <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pity Barack
        Obama. Everything in his life experience prepared him to be the president
        who would take on the big challenge of the 21st century: rising income inequality
        and the hollowing out of the middle class.</p>\r\n              <p>His peripatetic
        youth taught him about the price of plutocracy. In an interview unearthed
        by Zachary A. Goldfarb of the Washington Post, in 1995 Barack Obama, plugging
        his autobiography, \"Dreams From My Father,\" recalled that experience for
        the Hyde Park Citizen, his neighborhood edition of a newspaper that bills
        itself as the \"Premiere African American Weekly\" in Chicago.</p>\r\n              <p>\"My
        travels made me sensitive to the plight of those without power and the issues
        of class and inequalities as it relates to wealth and power,\" he said.</p>\r\n              <p>\"Anytime
        you have been overseas in these so-called Third World countries, one thing
        you see is a vast disparity of wealth of those who are part of the power structure
        and those outside of it.\"</p>\r\n              <p>As an adult, he didn''t
        take the obvious and lucrative path for an editor of the Harvard Law Review:
        a high-flying Wall Street career. Instead, Obama returned to Chicago and continued
        to focus on the issues of the underclass he had first addressed there as a
        community organizer.</p>\r\n              <p>Obama''s swift political ascent
        soon propelled him back into the world of the plutocrats, but even as he was
        pocketing their donations, he worried about coming to share their worldview.</p>\r\n              <p>In
        \"The Audacity of Hope,\" his second book, Obama writes that the financiers
        and lawyers who backed his 2004 run for the Senate were \"smart, interesting
        people\" who weren''t looking for a quid pro quo for backing him.</p>\r\n              <p>Even
        so, Obama feared that hanging out too much with the super-rich would skew
        his perspective. He was concerned, he wrote, about losing sight of the \"frequent
        hardship of the other 99 percent of the population \u2014 that is, the people
        that I''d entered public life to serve.\"</p>\r\n              <p>It is worth
        noting that Obama was writing about the 99 percent in 2006 \u2014 well before
        the Occupy Wall Street movement introduced that term into our collective discussion
        and before Obama''s presidential campaign introduced him into the national
        debate.</p>\r\n              <p>All of which meant that when Obama got to
        the most powerful political office in the world, he arrived intellectually
        and psychically equipped to take on the issue that America''s leading economists
        \u2014 and, being a wonk, Obama consulted many of them \u2014 were, at that
        moment, identifying as the big new economic fact of our time.</p>\r\n              <p>As
        things turned out, Obama didn''t start his presidency by addressing income
        inequality head-on: The small matter of a global financial crisis had to be
        taken care of first. But even in the face of the gravest economic meltdown
        since the Great Depression, Obama pressed on with one of his key initiatives
        to level America''s playing field: healthcare reform.</p>\r\n              <p>That
        drive, which cost so much political capital and yielded such a complex, emotionally
        unsatisfying result, is critical evidence of Obama''s commitment to the 99
        percent: Healthcare had been the big missing piece in America''s social safety
        net, a gap that became more dangerous as incomes and job security deteriorated
        for the middle class.</p>\r\n              <p>To understand the significance
        of Obama''s healthcare drive, it is worth remembering that there was another
        huge item still left on the liberal to-do list that a different president
        might have focused on: climate change. Among the president''s affluent backers,
        the green agenda trumped everything else, but for Americans experiencing \"frequent
        hardship\" the financial devastation of medical bills was the more urgent
        problem, hence Obama''s choice.</p>\r\n              <p>In 2012, Obama campaigned
        on his willingness to name inequality as the problem, and won on his promise
        to fix it: \"What drags down our entire economy,\" he said last spring, \"is
        when there is an ultrawide chasm between the ultrawealthy and everyone else.\"</p>\r\n              <p>With
        this week''s budget plan, Obama made good on that pledge. In the apt summary
        of Derek Thompson of The Atlantic, the haiku version of the president''s proposal
        is \"tax the rich, spare the poor, remember the young.\"</p>\r\n              <p>He
        wants to raise taxes at the top, including closing some of the loopholes that
        have enriched the plutocrats; help the poor, with measures like increasing
        the minimum wage; and increase opportunity for the young, with early childhood
        education.</p>\r\n              <p>Put these measures together with healthcare
        reform, recall the current American aversion to taxes and the country''s sorry
        fiscal state, and this amounts to a rather muscular attack on income inequality.</p>\r\n              <p>That''s
        where the pity comes in. Within the constraints of American politics and the
        American economy, Obama is addressing the issue he cares about most with a
        lot of energy. The tragedy is that the problem is still getting worse.</p>\r\n              <p>Wall
        Street has surged to pre-crisis highs, even as median incomes stagnate. At
        the very, very top, incomes are higher, and wealth is greater, than ever before.
        But for the 99 percent, unemployment remains crippling, and perhaps even more
        worryingly, the jobs that are coming back aren''t as good as the jobs they
        are replacing.</p>\r\n              <p>As Annie Lowrey of the New York Times
        has pointed out, the National Employment Law Project did a study last year
        that showed lower-wage occupations were 21 percent of recession losses, but
        58 percent of recovery growth. Meanwhile, mid-wage jobs were 60 percent of
        recession losses - but only 22 percent of recovery growth.</p>\r\n              <p>The
        problem is not, as the left sometimes complains, that Obama doesn''t care
        or that he isn''t trying hard enough. It is that the issue he has long been
        focused on has become more deeply entrenched and harder to fix over the past
        three decades. A diagnosis isn''t enough; doing something about it requires
        transformational leadership and a transformational agenda. Liberals need their
        own Margaret Thatcher, and they haven''t found her yet.</p>\r\n              <p>(Chrystia
