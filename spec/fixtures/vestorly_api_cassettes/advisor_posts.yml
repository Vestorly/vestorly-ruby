        better life means more than money, of course, but money enables the next generation
        to do more, live more comfortably and worry less about making the mortgage
        payments. Materialistic though it may be, it\u2019s part of the American Dream.\nSo
        it\u2019s alarming to see the drop in income that has taken place since 2007,
        when the financial crisis began. Census data (adjusted for inflation) show
        that median household income dropped from $56,000 to $51,017, which is a dip
        of nearly 10%.\nWe\u2019ve had dips before, as the chart below shows, particularly
        during the \u201cstagflation\u201d years of the late 1970s and early 1980s.
        Yet this has been the most dramatic drop in income in recent history.\n\n\u00a0\nWhen
        household income shrinks, some in the middle class risk sinking down to the
        lower class and those on the cusp of becoming middle class can no longer achieve
        that status. As the lower class grows, government expenditures grow, resulting
        in higher taxes and even further erosion of discretionary income for those
        in the middle class.\nWhen income decreases, consumers have less money to
        spend, so the economy stagnates and businesses grow at a slower rate.\nThe
        chart and the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s records do not yet go beyond 2012,
        so hopefully some of the lost income is now returning, but we won\u2019t know
        for sure until new numbers are available.\nOn a positive note, though, the
        chart shows that income levels may have stopped plummeting. According to the
        U.S. Census Bureau, \u201cReal median household income in the United States
        showed no statistically significant change between the 2011 ACS (American
        Community Survey) and the 2012 ACS. The ACS 2011 U.S. median household income
        was $51,324 and the ACS 2012 U.S. median household income was $51,371.\u201d\nStaying
        even is what passes for progress these days.\nNot every American has suffered
        a decrease in income. In fact, not every state experienced an income drop.
        Among those that did, however, the drop was huge in some cases.\nDelaware
        finished with the highest income reduction of any state \u2013 a 27% plunge,
        which brought its average household income down to $48,972. Mississippi\u2019s
        19.9% slide may not sound as bad, but Mississippi has the lowest income of
        any state at $36,641.\nMassachusetts, where I live, fared comparatively well.
        Our 6.1% drop, bringing average household income down to $63,656, ranks the
        commonwealth as having the ninth smallest drop in income.\nWhich state fared
        best? Maryland, which has the highest income of any state at $71,836, had
        a 1.2% drop. At the very top of the list, though, is Washington, D.C., which
        enjoyed its highest level of income ever in 2012 at $65,246.\nSo is this what
        President Barack Obama and members of Congress mean when they talk about income
        inequality? Maybe lawmakers should send part of their pay to Mississippi.\nOne
        reason household income is down, of course, is that a record number of Americans
        are out of work \u2013 more than 100 million.\nThat jobless total appears
        to be growing, even as the unemployment rate falls, as the number of Americans
        seeking unemployment benefits jumped to 317,000 recently. If enough people
        stop working, someday we can achieve full employment.\nThe economy gained
        217,000 jobs in May, which is one of the largest gains in two-and-a-half years,
        but do the math \u2013 317,000 minus 217,000 is a net job loss.\nWhat\u2019s
        really dismaying is that the unemployment rate has dropped from 6.7% to 6.3%,
        because more people stopped looking for work.\nFollow AdviceIQ on Twitter

        tops or bottoms is generally quite difficult as one often does not have clear
        technical divergences that can give them enough conviction and discipline
        to take a position. Oftentimes traders will convince themselves that a market
        can\u2019t go any higher or lower and keep fighting the trend as they are
        repeatedly stopped out.\r\n\r\nSuccessful trading or investing is dependent
        on trying to put the odds in your favor and then having a clear exit strategy
        for when you are wrong. The S&P 500 had several wide swings in 2012, which
        made it a difficult year for many traders and investors. Buy and hold was
        only possible for those who were totally oblivious to current events.\r\n\r\nDespite
        the powerful performance of the stock market in 2013 there were several classic
        corrections that allowed both traders and investors to buy. Clearly, 2014
        has been even a more difficult year. To successfully trade retracements, you
        need to have patience and there are several technical tools that can help
        you identify in advance potential buying or selling zones.\r\n\r\nTypically,
        when a retracement is ending, it will be a difficult time for the investor
        or trader as the market momentum and the sentiment is at a level that causes
        many to question their analysis making it more difficult to act.\r\n\r\nI
        realized early in my career that most retracements take longer than one expects
        as one must consider how long the prior rally or decline has lasted. For example,
        if a rally last three or four months then a three-four week correction would
        not be surprising. On the other hand, if the breakout rally last just three
        weeks, a five- or six-day correction is often enough.","client_only":false,"comment":null,"created_at":"2014-07-29T02:30:56Z","display_tag":null,"down_votes":0,"draft_post_id":null,"external_id":"53d4fce573d3b9990d000049","external_url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2014/07/27/finding-high-probability-entry-levels-2/","external_url_source":"http://www.forbes.com/markets/feed","external_url_type":"basic","for_approval":false,"from_newscred":true,"group_ids":["539a92d8de6219571e0000e6","5372e1b1f79a9600020000b2","537d32a5e2359c0002000010","537d32a5e2359c0002000013","534f665f9460a71472000220"],"has_sent":false,"image_big_url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/s3-data.vestorly.com/post_images/53d4fcec73d3b9990d00004a/large.jpg","image_small_url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/s3-data.vestorly.com/post_images/53d4fcec73d3b9990d00004a/small.jpg","image_url":"https://d3i4lqsaxjar6n.cloudfront.net/post_images/53d4fcec73d3b9990d00004a/large.jpg","img":null,"img_changed":false,"img_compressed":false,"impressions_count":null,"is_added_to_newsletter":false,"is_clone":false,"is_curate":false,"is_draft":false,"is_featured":false,"is_pre_approved":false,"is_proxy_needed":true,"is_published":true,"is_responsive":true,"link":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2014/07/27/finding-high-probability-entry-levels-2/","logo_url":"//s3.amazonaws.com/assets-vestorly/logos/forbes_logo.png","message_clicks":0,"message_sign_ups":0,"messages":0,"needs_sanitize":true,"newsletter_ids":[],"newsletter_sent_at":null,"number_of_views":0,"parent_post_id":null,"post_date":"2014-07-29T02:30:56+00:00","prospect_only":false,"publish_to_social":null,"published_at":"2014-07-29T02:30:59+00:00","published_post_cacheid":"53d70760c3b5a0e351000011","random":10005.179409313329,"rss_feed_url":"http://www.forbes.com/markets/feed","send_on_publish":false,"sent_newsletter_ids":[],"slug":"finding-high-probability-entry-levels-1","suitability_score":0.0,"title":"Finding
